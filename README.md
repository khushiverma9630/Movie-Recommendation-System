Project Title:
Movie Recommendation System
This movie recommendation system leverages machine learning algorithms to provide personalized movie suggestions. The system analyzes user ratings, movie metadata, and preferences to recommend movies.
Technologies Used:
Dataset: Kaggle TMDB Dataset (for movie data)
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling.
scikit-learn: To implement machine learning algorithms like collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
Pickle: To serialize and deserialize trained machine learning models.
NLTK: For text processing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
API: TMDb API (for fetching movie data)
Web Framework: Streamlit (for building the web interface)
Usage:
Once the application is running, users can interact with the movie recommendation system through a web interface built with Streamlit. The system allows users to:
Input a movie title to receive recommendations based on similar content or user preferences.
Browse personalized movie suggestions.
Filter movie recommendations by genre,cast,crew etc.
